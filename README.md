# Productive
A macOS status bar application born from a shower thought.

If you're only using the mouse, are you really being productive? That sounds like link surfing to me...
In more detail: If you're actively using your machine, but haven't touched the keyboard in twenty minutes, this will present a Notification reminding you.

This also serves as an exploration of status bar applications.

TODOs:
1. Update status bar icon
2. Add Preferences to change your reminder time
3. If you've been away from the computer for a while and the first thing you do is use the mouse, you'll get a reminder. That should be easy to mitigate.
